## Introduction

In today's fast-changing world, the way people eat is evolving. This project dives into the dinner habits of Canadians, exploring how different age groups, income levels, and regions approach their meals. We wanted to answer questions like:
- What types of meals are most popular?
- How do income and age affect dining preferences?
- What are the regional differences in cuisine choices?

By analyzing these trends, we can better understand what Canadians prefer to eat and how businesses can adapt to these preferences.

## Dataset Description

We worked with a dataset that included the following key columns:
- **Region**: Where the respondents live (Canadian provinces).
- **Age Group**: Grouping respondents into categories based on their age.
- **Income Level**: Dividing respondents by their income levels to observe spending patterns.
- **Meal Type**: Whether the meal was eaten at home, ordered as takeout, or consumed at a restaurant.
  
These factors allowed us to explore how demographics affect dining choices across Canada.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before we could analyze the data, we needed to clean it to ensure accuracy. Here’s what we did:
- **Removed duplicates**: Any repeated entries were deleted to avoid bias.
- **Handled missing data**: For missing values, we either filled in the blanks where appropriate or removed rows when necessary.
- **Dealt with outliers**: Extreme values that could skew the data were either capped or removed.
- **Categorized data**: Categorical variables like Meal Type were encoded for better analysis.

For these steps, we used Microsoft Excel’s built-in functions like `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGE`, and `SUM`.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Meal Type Preferences**
   - Younger Canadians (ages 18-24) prefer takeout and fast food, while older Canadians are more likely to cook at home.
   - Higher-income households tend to dine at restaurants more frequently, spending more on dining out and premium ingredients.

### 2. **Cuisine Preferences**
   - **Mexican cuisine** is the most popular choice across all age groups, especially for takeout.
   - On the other hand, **Italian cuisine** was the least popular, showing less preference among respondents.

### 3. **Regional Trends**
   - **British Columbia** residents showed a strong preference for Greek cuisine.
   - In **Nova Scotia**, Indian cuisine was particularly popular.

## Visualizations

To better understand and present the findings, we created various visualizations:
- **Bar Charts**: Used to compare meal preferences across different age groups and income levels. For instance, we showed that young adults aged 18-24 have a higher preference for takeout.
- **Pie Charts**: These helped us show the distribution of different cuisine preferences, highlighting that Mexican cuisine is the top choice.
- **Line Charts**: These charts were used to track how spending on meals varies based on age and income, revealing spending patterns over time.

All these visualizations were created in Power BI for a clear and engaging presentation.

## Conclusion

In summary, the analysis reveals several important insights about Canadian dining habits:
- Younger Canadians prefer convenience, such as takeout, while older Canadians enjoy cooking at home.
- Higher-income individuals spend more on dining out and prefer premium ingredients.

Understanding these trends can help restaurants and food-related businesses cater to their target audiences more effectively.

## Business Applications

The findings of this analysis can have practical applications for businesses, especially in the food and restaurant industry. Here’s how:
- **Targeted Marketing**: Restaurants can offer special takeout deals for younger audiences or create meal delivery services that cater to older customers who prefer home-cooked meals.
- **Menu Development**: Knowing the popularity of certain cuisines, such as Mexican or Greek, restaurants can adjust their menus based on the regional and demographic preferences.
- **Pricing Strategies**: High-income individuals are more likely to spend on premium ingredients, so businesses can introduce gourmet or high-end offerings to attract this group.

By leveraging these insights, businesses can enhance customer satisfaction and drive growth by aligning their products with the dining preferences of different demographic groups.
